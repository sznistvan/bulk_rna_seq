[2022-11-26 22:15:46.648] [jointLog] [info] Counted 651,259 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-11-26 22:15:46.650] [jointLog] [warning] 0.406469% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
